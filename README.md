KangarooHybrid to help solve the 100 BTC Bitcoin Challenge

This version is a combination of Jean Luc's VanitySearch and Alek76's KangarooHybrid; with small tweaks made by me to speed up the process of finding the private key.

I am setting this up to help capture the 100 BTC Bitcoin challenge ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5218972.0 ) using GPUs only, no CPU function at this time; and I only compiled for Windows users. 

For right now, the only challenges we are going after are the ones that have their bitcoin public key exposed (#120, #125, #130, etc....using a version of Pollard's Kangaroo method with distinguished points. 

With many people helping, we should be able to break the #120 puzzle rather quickly, which is worth 1.20 Bitcoins. Members will be paid for the percentage of work they submit. Think of it like a mining pool, but without the automation. I am not a programmer by trade and therefore I do not have the skillsets to set up a server, WITH VALIDATION, to capture everyone's work/submissions.

But it is rather simple to get started and help out and earn some Bitcoin.
  
Step 1: Go to the "Releases" secion and download the .exe program, the solver-all.py file, and the batch (.bat) files.

Step 2: Add all of those files into one folder on your PC.

Step 3: Adjust the batch file to how many GPUs you have or will use. 
Example: 
-gpuId represents the devices. If you are using one GPU, use -gpuId 0; if you use two GPUs 
-gpuId 0,1; if you use three GPUs -gpuid 0,1,2; etc.

Step 4: Run the .exe file and let it run. You will see tame and wild text files start filling up in the same folder.

Step 5: Once you are ready to submit work, stop the .exe file from running and send me the tame and wild text files (via DM on Discord; DM me and I will send you email address). I have included example batch files to combine your wild and tame files so you only have to send one tame file and one wild file.

Step 6: Rinse and repeat Steps 4 and 5.
